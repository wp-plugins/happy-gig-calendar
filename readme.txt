A gig calendar plugin designed for artists to easily promote shows. Supports styled content, images and a link to purchase tickets.

== Description ==

IYBI is a creative digital agency based in Sydney. With several clients in the music industry, we saw a real need for a user-friendly tool which allows artists to manage and display a calendar of gigs on their websites. The Wordpress Happy Gig Calendar allows artists to quickly and easily create a gig listing including date, time, title, location, description and link to purchase tickets, with the option of including images.

= Features =
* Ability to set start and end date for gig spanning several days
* Ability to include images, videos, text styling, links and shortcodes in Gig Description with the Wordpress WYSIWYG editor
* A duplicate function on existing gigs
* Includes a widget with the ability to set the number of gigs shown
* The ability to view all gigs in the past through an archive
* Advanced shortcode options allowing you to display gigs in a particular date range or by specific gig ID

The Wordpress Happy Gig Calendar can be placed on any page or post on your site using the shortcode or featured as a sidebar widget. 

Requires WordPress 3.3 higher.

1. Upload the folder 'wordpress-gig-calendar' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory,
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Insert the shortcode [wpgigs] wherever you want the calendar to appear (advanced display options in documentation).
4. Start adding gigs through the 'Wordpress Happy Gig Calendar' menu.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
